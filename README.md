An extensive Python API for Metal Archives database.<br>
Inspired by [pymetal](https://github.com/OpenJarbas/pymetal), [metalarchives](https://github.com/Loki-Afro/metalarchives) and [python-metallum](https://github.com/lcharlick/python-metallum).<br>
Most Python-based Metal Archives APIs that I've seen were either over-engineered or lacking, usually with a badly structured codebase. Thus this project was born.
